Installation
------------

0. ** install MongoDB **
	
	Recommended to do the following:
	
			brew install mongodb

	Then get cracking:

1.    Run

	    	bundle install

	from the directory

2.	You'll also need **rdf/raptor** to process RDF files:

	    	brew install raptor

	Now you are ready, you can type:

	    	ruby app.rb

	to get started.

3.	Navigate to ``localhost:4567`` and let the magic begin.
